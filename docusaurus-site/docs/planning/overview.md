# Planning & Specification Overview

This section contains the foundational planning documents for the Physical AI Capstone Quarter research paper project.

## Project Documents

### 📋 [Feature Specification](specification)
Complete feature specification with:
- **6 User Stories** (P1-P6) with priorities and acceptance criteria
- **25 Functional Requirements** covering content, citations, and quality
- **10 Success Criteria** with measurable outcomes
- **Out of Scope** boundaries and edge case handling

**Key Highlights**:
- P1 (Literature Review): Foundation for entire paper
- P2 (Curriculum Design): Pedagogical framework analysis
- P3-P6: Technical depth and evaluation
- All stories independently testable

### 🏗️ [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan)
Detailed implementation strategy including:
- **Technical Context**: Document type, tools (Zotero, Markdown, Word)
- **Constitution Check**: All 6 principles with validation gates
- **Project Structure**: Paper directory organization (paper/01-introduction through paper/09-references)
- **Post-Design Evaluation**: Constitutional compliance status

**Word Count Allocation**:
- P1: 1,500 words | P2: 1,200 words | P3: 1,000 words
- P4: 800 words | P5: 700 words | P6: 600 words
- **Total**: ~6,500 words (within 5,000-7,000 target)

### ✅ [Task Breakdown](tasks)
Comprehensive task list with **162 tasks** across 13 phases:
- **Phase 1**: Setup (10 tasks) - Zotero, directories, Git
- **Phase 2**: Literature Search (26 tasks) - **BLOCKS all writing**
- **Phases 3-10**: User Stories P1-P6 (60 tasks) - Content drafting
- **Checkpoints**: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% validation (28 tasks)
- **Phase 12**: Final Assembly + Constitutional Gates (35 tasks)
- **Phase 13**: Optional enhancements (6 tasks)

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (48 tasks) = Standalone literature review

### 🔍 [Research Strategy](research-strategy)
Literature search methodology:
- **10 Research Questions** mapped to sources
- **Search Queries** for IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar
- **Target**: ≥15 sources (≥10 peer-reviewed initially, buffer above 8 minimum)
- **Source Allocation**: P1: 4-5, P2: 2-3, P3-P6: 1-2 each
- **Zotero Workflow**: Import, tagging, annotation, export

## Constitutional Principles

All work governed by 6 core principles:

1. **Primary Source Verification** - All claims traceable to verifiable sources
2. **Citation Integrity** - APA 7th edition format mandatory
3. **Peer-Reviewed Priority** - ≥50% peer-reviewed sources (≥8 of 15)
4. **Zero Plagiarism Tolerance** - 0% similarity score required
5. **Writing Clarity** - Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 target
6. **Reproducibility** - All results reproducible with cited methodology

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Source Verification
- [ ] Every claim traced to source
- [ ] All sources accessible
- [ ] ≥8 peer-reviewed sources
- [ ] ≥15 total sources

### Gate 2: Citation Compliance
- [ ] APA 7th edition format
- [ ] Complete references with DOI/URL
- [ ] 100% citation-reference match
- [ ] All URLs/DOIs functional

### Gate 3: Plagiarism Check
- [ ] 0% similarity (excluding citations)
- [ ] Proper quotation marks and attribution

### Gate 4: Writing Quality
- [ ] FK grade 10-12
- [ ] All terms defined on first use
- [ ] 5,000-7,000 words
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked

### Gate 5: Reproducibility
- [ ] Methods documented for replication
- [ ] Claims linked to specific source locations

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential (Recommended)
1. Setup → Literature Search (BLOCKS rest)
2. US1 (P1) → validate → proceed
3. US2-US6 sequentially with checkpoints
4. Final assembly and gate validation

### Incremental Delivery
- After US1: 1,500 words (foundational)
- After US2: +1,200 words (practical value)
- After US3: +1,000 words (technical expertise)
- Continue through US6 for complete paper

## Timeline Estimate

- **Research (Phase 2)**: 8-12 hours
- **P1 Drafting**: 8-10 hours
- **P2-P6 Drafting**: 15-20 hours
- **Revision & Citation**: 6-8 hours
- **Final Assembly**: 4-6 hours
- **Total**: 41-56 hours (1-2 weeks full-time, 4-6 weeks part-time)

## Next Steps

1. Review [Feature Specification](specification) for detailed requirements
2. Check [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan) for technical context
3. Use [Task Breakdown](tasks) as execution checklist
4. Follow [Research Strategy](research-strategy) for literature search
