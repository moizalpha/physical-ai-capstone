# Simulation Platform Comparison (P4)

**User Story 4** - Simulation Technologies: Comparative Analysis

**Priority**: P4

**Word Count Target**: ~800 words (700-900 acceptable)

**Peer-Reviewed Sources Required**: ≥1 source

## Purpose

Compare physics simulation capabilities, sensor simulation fidelity, and integration patterns across three platforms: Gazebo (open-source physics), Unity (high-fidelity rendering), NVIDIA Isaac (photorealistic AI simulation).

## Subsections to be Created

### Gazebo Analysis (~250 words)
- Open-source physics simulation
- Physics engines: ODE, Bullet, DART
- Sensor plugins and ROS integration
- Educational use cases

### Unity Analysis (~250 words)
- Game engine for robotics
- High visual fidelity with HDRP
- Unity Robotics Hub and ROS-TCP-Connector
- HRI scenario development

### NVIDIA Isaac Comparison (~300 words)
- Photorealistic rendering with RTX
- GPU-accelerated physics (PhysX 5)
- Synthetic data generation for AI
- Isaac ROS integration

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ Comparative claims supported by benchmarking studies, technical specs, or reproducible experiments
✅ Terms defined: physics engine, sensor simulation, sim-to-real transfer
✅ Word count 700-900 words
✅ ≥1 peer-reviewed source cited

**Status**: Awaiting P1-P3 completion before drafting
