# AI-Robot Integration (P5)

**User Story 5** - AI-Robot Integration: Vision-Language-Action Systems

**Priority**: P5

**Word Count Target**: ~700 words (600-800 acceptable)

**Peer-Reviewed Sources Required**: ≥2 sources

## Purpose

Analyze advanced AI integration patterns including VSLAM navigation, vision-language-action models, speech processing, and multi-modal perception for natural human-robot interaction.

## Subsections to be Created

### VSLAM Navigation (~250 words)
- Visual SLAM problem definition
- ORB-SLAM3 algorithm overview
- Isaac ROS GPU-accelerated VSLAM
- Nav2 stack integration

### Vision-Language-Action Models (~250 words)
- VLA motivation and architecture
- RT-1, RT-2 model examples
- Training: large-scale robot data and sim-to-real
- ROS 2 integration as action server

### Multi-Modal Perception (~200 words)
- Sensor fusion approaches
- Camera + LiDAR + IMU integration
- Kalman filtering and extensions
- ROS 2 robot_localization package

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ Claims about VSLAM, VLA, multi-modal models traceable to recent AI/robotics papers (2022-2025)
✅ Terms defined: VSLAM, VLA, ORB-SLAM3, RT-1, RT-2, sensor fusion
✅ Word count 600-800 words
✅ ≥2 peer-reviewed sources cited

**Status**: Awaiting P1-P4 completion before drafting
