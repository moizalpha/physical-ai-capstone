# Curriculum Design Analysis (P2)

**User Story 2** - Curriculum Design Analysis and Pedagogical Framework

**Priority**: P2

**Word Count Target**: ~1,200 words (1,000-1,400 acceptable)

**Peer-Reviewed Sources Required**: ≥2 sources

## Purpose

Analyze the three-module curriculum structure (ROS 2, Digital Twin, AI-Robot Brain) from pedagogical perspective, establishing learning progression rationale and alignment with educational best practices.

## Subsections to be Created

### Module Structure Analysis (~450 words)
- Three-module progressive structure
- Learning sequence justification with cognitive load theory
- Scaffolding from ROS 2 fundamentals to advanced AI
- Bloom's taxonomy progression

### Pedagogical Framework (~400 words)
- Constructivist learning principles
- Project-based learning application
- Spiral curriculum approach
- Authentic assessment strategies

### Technology Selection Rationale (~350 words)
- ROS 2 as industry standard
- Multi-platform simulation strategy
- Open-source priority with commercial tool exposure
- Python emphasis for accessibility

## Acceptance Criteria

✅ Curriculum design decisions justified with educational theory citations (Bloom's taxonomy, constructivist learning, etc.)
✅ Similar robotics curriculum examples from peer-reviewed sources referenced
✅ Word count 1,000-1,400 words
✅ ≥2 peer-reviewed sources cited

**Status**: Awaiting P1 completion before drafting
