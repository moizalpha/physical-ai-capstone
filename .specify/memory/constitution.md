# AI-Native Software Development Research Paper Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Primary Source Verification

All factual claims, statistics, technical descriptions, and assertions MUST be traceable to verifiable primary sources. No claim may be included based solely on general knowledge or secondary interpretation.

**Rationale**: Academic rigor requires evidence-based argumentation. Every statement must withstand peer review scrutiny with clear provenance.

### II. Citation Integrity

All sources MUST be cited using APA style format. Citations must be complete, accurate, and properly formatted according to the 7th edition of the APA Publication Manual.

**Requirements**:
- In-text citations with author and year: (Author, Year)
- Full reference list with all bibliographic details
- Page numbers for direct quotes
- DOI or URL for electronic sources

**Rationale**: Proper citation enables reproducibility, gives credit to original authors, and allows readers to verify claims.

### III. Peer-Reviewed Source Priority

A minimum of 50% of all cited sources MUST be peer-reviewed academic publications (journal articles, conference proceedings, academic books).

**Acceptable peer-reviewed sources**:
- Journal articles from recognized academic publishers
- Conference proceedings from established academic conferences
- Academic press books with editorial review
- Doctoral dissertations from accredited institutions

**Supplementary sources** (up to 50%):
- Technical documentation from authoritative sources
- Industry white papers from reputable organizations
- Government and institutional reports
- Reputable technical blogs (only for current/emerging topics)

**Rationale**: Peer-reviewed sources ensure quality control, methodological rigor, and academic credibility.

### IV. Zero Plagiarism Tolerance

All content MUST be original or properly quoted and cited. Plagiarism checks MUST show 0% similarity to existing sources (excluding properly cited quotes and references).

**Requirements**:
- Run plagiarism detection before final submission
- All borrowed language must be in quotation marks with citation
- Paraphrasing must be substantial and cited
- Common knowledge still requires context-appropriate citation in academic writing

**Rationale**: Academic integrity is non-negotiable. Even unintentional plagiarism undermines credibility and violates ethical standards.

### V. Writing Clarity and Accessibility

Writing MUST target a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 10-12, appropriate for an academic audience with computer science background.

**Requirements**:
- Clear, precise technical language
- Defined jargon and acronyms on first use
- Logical paragraph structure with topic sentences
- Active voice preferred over passive where appropriate
- Transitions between sections and arguments

**Rationale**: Academic writing should be rigorous but accessible to the target audience. Overly complex language obscures meaning rather than conveying expertise.

### VI. Reproducibility and Traceability

All experimental results, data analyses, code examples, and technical claims MUST be reproducible by readers with access to the cited sources and documented methodology.

**Requirements**:
- Document all methodologies clearly
- Provide sufficient detail for replication
- Link claims to specific sources (page numbers, sections)
- Archive supporting materials when applicable

**Rationale**: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry and academic credibility.

## Quality Standards

### Source Requirements

- **Minimum source count**: 15 sources
- **Peer-reviewed minimum**: 50% of total sources (≥8 sources)
- **Source currency**: Prefer sources from last 5 years for technical topics; foundational works may be older
- **Source diversity**: Multiple perspectives and methodologies where applicable

### Document Specifications

- **Word count**: 5,000-7,000 words (excluding references and appendices)
- **Format**: PDF with embedded citations and hyperlinked references where possible
- **Structure**: Title page, abstract, introduction, body sections, conclusion, references
- **Figures and tables**: All must be original or properly attributed with permissions

### Citation Standards

- **Style**: APA 7th edition
- **Completeness**: No missing references; no citations without references
- **Accuracy**: All URLs functional; all DOIs valid; all publication details correct
- **Consistency**: Uniform citation style throughout

## Verification Gates

All deliverables MUST pass these gates before submission:

### Gate 1: Source Verification
- [ ] Every claim traced to a specific source
- [ ] All sources accessible and verifiable
- [ ] Peer-reviewed source percentage ≥50%
- [ ] Minimum 15 sources met

### Gate 2: Citation Compliance
- [ ] All citations in APA 7th edition format
- [ ] In-text citations match reference list
- [ ] No missing citations or references
- [ ] All DOIs and URLs validated

### Gate 3: Plagiarism Check
- [ ] Plagiarism detection run (Turnitin, iThenticate, or equivalent)
- [ ] Similarity score 0% (excluding properly cited material)
- [ ] All quotes properly marked and cited
- [ ] Paraphrasing is substantial and attributed

### Gate 4: Writing Quality
- [ ] Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10-12
- [ ] Technical terms defined on first use
- [ ] Logical flow and coherent argumentation
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked
- [ ] Word count within 5,000-7,000 range

### Gate 5: Reproducibility
- [ ] Methods documented sufficiently for replication
- [ ] Data sources identified and accessible
- [ ] Code examples tested and functional
- [ ] Claims linked to specific source locations

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and preferences for this research paper project. All work must comply with these principles and standards.

**Amendment Process**:
- Amendments require documentation of rationale
- Version number must increment per semantic versioning
- All dependent templates and documentation must be updated
- Major changes require constitutional review before implementation

**Compliance Verification**:
- All drafts must pass verification gates before progression
- Peer review and advisor feedback take precedence for academic judgment
- When constitution conflicts with institutional requirements, institutional requirements take precedence (document exceptions)

**Quality Assurance**:
- Intermediate reviews at 25%, 50%, 75% completion
- Full gate verification before final submission
- External plagiarism check before submission
- Final proofreading by independent reviewer recommended

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-17 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-17
